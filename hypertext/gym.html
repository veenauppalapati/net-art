            I should have studied and finish my assignments.  <br>
            How can I workout peacefully when I have tons of deadlines coming up. <br>
            Whatever I am here! Just get through it! <br>

            Ok I am done! Whew so glad I got this out of the way. <br>
            <h1>WORKOUT COMPLETE!!</h1>

            Now that I got my workout done,  I can have the ultimate focus. <br>
            
            I will get my smoothie and then be diligent with my school work.<br>

            After a delicious smoothie ...<br>

            Now let's get to WORK!<br>
            <img src="./img/work.gif"><br>
            
            
            Wait why am I still hungry even after the smoothie? <br>

            Maybe I should just have a solid <a href="./food.html">food</a> in my system before I start off this assignment.
