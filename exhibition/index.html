    <h1><em>Are We Conformed to Digital Standards?</em></h1>
    <h2>Curated by Veena Uppalapati</h2>
    <p class="typed-out">
        In our modern day, digital devices are essential components of our lives. We rely on them for almost everything, from collecting information and searching to writing, reading, and exploring. The works selected for this curation share a common theme, digital performance from the artist’s perspective, showcasing the common tasks we perform daily on our devices. <br><br>
        In each of these works, artists invite us into their digital window, creating an immediate sense of familiarity. This connection is profound, reflecting our own digital habits and fostering an appreciation for the commonalities we share in our digital interactions. Unlike traditional art forms, such as paintings and drawings, which may astonish us with their execution but sometimes distract from the underlying message, these digital works forge an instant connection. We recognize not only the medium but also the tasks being performed, making the experience deeply relatable.<br><br>
        This curation highlights a significant evolution in our interaction with technology, illustrating how our reliance on multiple tools and devices has streamlined into dependence on a singular device. This makes us wonder, are our behaviors becoming automated and predictable? Are we being standardized without even realizing it? <br>
