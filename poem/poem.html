    <b>[Intro]</b><br>
    <em>
      Look... If you had... one shot... or one opportunity...<br>
      To seize everything you ever wanted... one moment...<br>
      Would you capture it? Or just let it slip?<br>
      Yo<br>

    <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
    <em>   
      His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy <br>
      There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti <br>
      He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready <br>
      to drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting <br>
      what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud <br>
      He opens his mouth but the words won't come out <br>
      He's chokin, how? Everybody's jokin now <br>
      The clock's run out, time's up, over - BLAOW! <br>
      Snap back to reality, OHH! there goes gravity <br>
      OHH! there goes Rabbit, he choked <br>
      He's so mad, but he won't <br>
      Give up that easy nope, he won't have it <br>
      He knows, his whole back's to these ropes <br>
      It don't matter, he's dope <br>
      He knows that, but he's broke <br>
      He's so sad that he knows <br>
      when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's <br>
      back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shift <br>
      He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</p>

    <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
    <em>   
      You better - lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
      You own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
      You better - lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
      You own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
      You better..   <br>

    <b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
    <em>   
      Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
      This world is mine for the taking<br>
      Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order<br>
      A normal life is boring; but superstardom's<br>
      close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br>
      Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over<br>
      These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows<br>
      He's known as the Globetrotter<br>
      Lonely roads, God only knows<br>
      He's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
      He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
      But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water<br>
      These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
      They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
      He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
      is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner<br>
      But the beat goes on da-da-dum da-dum da-dah <br>
    </em>

    <b>[Verse 3]</b><br>
    <em>   
      No more games, Imma change what you call rage<br>
      Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged<br>
      I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>
      I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
      But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
      Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper<br>
      All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
      fact that I can't get by with my nine to<br>
      five and I can't provide the right type of<br>
      life for my family, cause man, these God damn<br>
      food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie<br>
      There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
      And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder<br>
      Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter<br>
      Caught up between bein a father and a pre-madonna<br>
      Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna<br>
      stay in one spot, another day of monotony<br>
      has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got<br>
      to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot<br>
      Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not<br>
      Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go<br>
      I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
      So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not<br>
      This may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
